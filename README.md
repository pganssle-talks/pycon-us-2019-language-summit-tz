# Time Zones in the Standard Library

This is the repository for the talk "Time Zones in the Standard Library", a 10-minute talk to be given as part of the [PyCon 2019 Language Summit](https://us.pycon.org/2019/events/language-summit/).

In this talk, I will propose adding more concrete time zone classes to the Python standard library, an IANA time zone class and possibly a "local time" time zone class, and cover some of the biggest challenges and unsolved questions.
